Welcome to nabs's documentation!
================================

This is the landing site for shared code that interfaces with bluesky and
pcdsdaq for beamline automation and data collection routines for LCLS photon
science.

It is named NABS, Not a Beamline Scientist, because it is the go-to when the
question is "Who should be doing this procedure?" and the answer is "Not a
Beamline Scientist!", e.g. it is something that should not be done by hand.
